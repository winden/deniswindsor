			<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go to town,&#8221; I said.</p>
			<p>They looked at me admiringly. With three hundred almost indestructible androids on the loose I was the big brave hero. I grinned at them and hoped they couldn&#8217;t see the sweat on my face. Then I walked over to the Copter and climbed in.</p>
			<p>&#8220;Coming?&#8221; I asked.</p>
			<p>Jack was pale under his freckles but Chief Dalton grinned back at me. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be right behind you, Morrison,&#8221; he said.</p>
			<p>Behind me! So they could pick up the pieces. I gave them a cocky smile and switched on the engine, full speed.</p>
